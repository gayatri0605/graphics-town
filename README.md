## Artist Statement

Describe what you were trying to make:
A small neighbourhood with a park and a construction site

## Straightforward Checks

Please list how your assignment fills the requirements. In cases where you have more than the requirements (e.g., 2,3,5,6) just list the most interesting ones. A short description (a few words) is probably sufficient. Leave blank or say "N/A" for things you didn't do.

Note: the other checks we can see easily.

2. 2 different kinds of objects that you made (just list 2)
    1.A Sun that has a pointlight and revovles around the town
    2.trees

3.  5 different kinds of objects beyond #2. (just list 5)
    1.A mud heap for the construction site
    2.an airplane that goes around
    3.a forklift
    4.a carousel with rotating horses 
    5.a car 

5. 3 different behaviors. (just list 3)
    1.horses going up and down on a carousel
    2.airplane that goes around
    3.car that goes around a spline track

6. At least 3 objects must be "rideable"
    1.horses on the carousel
    2.car on the track
    3.either airplane

7. "train track" with a "train" (tell us how we know its a spline)
    1. created a spline by using the curve in space

8. One object from each category
    - buildings:house
    - natural elements:tree
    - vehicles:airplane

9. There is at least one model loaded from a file. (e.g. loading a `.obj` or `.fbx` file)
    1. N/A

10. There is at least one shader that you wrote.
    - what object is it on: coded a mountain shader 
    - describe:tried to make mountains 
    - filename:mountains.fs, mountain.vs

12. SkyBox or some other texture (list one - and say why you didn't have skybox if you don't have one)
    1. created a textured platform with a bumpmap and a skybox

## Complexity Points

Describe each thing that you did that you think is worth complexity points.

If possible, order them from most interesting to least interesting.

Describe what the thing is, where we can see it, and why it deserves complexity points.

Note: put "####" (4 hash marks) and number the complex things to make it easier for us to identify them, but put the description on a separate line. We've given you the first 2 headers

#### Complex Thing 1: 
I created snow that changes the orientation depending on what angle you view it at

#### Complex Thing 2:
